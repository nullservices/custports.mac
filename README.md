# custports.mac
EQ Druid Port/Buff bot w/ NPC like dialog. 

Utilizes MQ2Cast &amp; the /casting command for ports &amp; buffs.

Based on TheDroodUrLookingFor PortBot.mac -- https://www.mmobugs.com/forums/index.php?threads/guild-port-bot.32205/

Butchered and rebuilt it for my own needs on the eqemu Retribution server. Find Donnie the druid in the bazaar for a demo & services.



## Future Updates

Add fail safes for actions requested if the person is not in the group.

Add fail safes for being in group after port duration or in group without porting for a time period.

Add port/buff announcement on a timer

Create port categorization by continent/area

Add donation message / thanks after accepting trade.

Auto recast if fizzle

Include a Memming spell & Casting spell announcement

Decline invites.

## Ideas

Store names & donations.

Create a leaderboard for top donations. Can have it in a dialog as "[donators] / [donors] / [leaderboard]"
